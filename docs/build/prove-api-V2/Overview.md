# Prove API

## Overview

### API for Requesting Proofs
The Prove API takes inspiration from Superchain's native interop to define an identifier. This version of the API is designed to prove individual logs.

#### Current Capabilities:
Before an on-chain message can be sent, the "Appplication relayer" or "solver" must first query the Prove API.
1. **Request Proof:** Use the `log_requestProof` method to request a proof, which returns a `jobID`.
2. **Poll for Proof:** Use the `log_queryProof` method with the `jobID` to poll for proof responses.

### On-chain Contract for Validating Proofs 

We deploy a contract known as the `CrossL2ProverV2` ([contract info](https://docs.polymerlabs.org/docs/build/start/)), taking inspiration from Superchain interop's [CrossL2Inbox](https://specs.optimism.io/interop/predeploys.html#crossl2inbox).

#### Current Capabilities:

1. **Polymer State Validation:** Validates the state root of the Polymer rollup for a given block height, as attested by the sequencer. Ensures that the state root serves as the single source of truth within the network.
2. **Log Validation:** Exposes a predefined validation method that allows applications to verify logs using a provided proof. Enables applications to confirm the authenticity of a log and retrieve detailed log information securely.
3. **Proof Inspection:** Provides methods for applications to perform static calls to the contract to inspect different components of a proof. Enhances transparency by allowing applications to analyze proof data before submission.


**Note:** Polymer is a rollup that continuously builds blocks and updates its state. As a result, proofs are most cost-effective within a recent time window. Currently, for testing purposes, we provide proofs for the last 3â€“4 hours, as proof retrieving data deeper in the rollup trie becomes increasingly expensive.

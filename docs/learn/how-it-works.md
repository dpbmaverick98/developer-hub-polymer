# How It Works

Polymer extends the concept of rollups, much like how rollups efficiently batch user transactions and submit them to Ethereum for speed and scalability. Unlike traditional rollups that focus on transaction batching, Polymer bundles entire rollup states and propagates them across the network in real time.
This state-level approach ensures developers can verify any action done on-chain like events, and storage slots seamlessly, all while leveraging a unified proof system.

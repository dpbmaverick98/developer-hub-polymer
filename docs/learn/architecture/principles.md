# Polymer Principles

Polymer’s architecture blends rollup-inspired concepts with native blockchain features—such as public verifiability and state proofs. Goal is to create an open interoperability protocol, rather than positioning Polymer as a central authority.

Our mission is to simplify devX and give them tools they can trust, thus the foundation of Polymer rests on two core ideas:

1. State Proofs Over Off-Chain Messages
2. Publicly Verifiable Rollup Over Closed Infrastructure

Let’s break these down.

### 1. State Proofs Over Off-Chain Messages

Cross-chain messaging can often feel unpredictable—relying on processes you can’t fully see or control. That’s why Polymer takes a different path. By handling state data directly offers a stronger and cryptographic way for verifying **events**, **receipts**, and **storage slot** claims—**all within seconds.**

We embed entire block headers (representing rollup states) from multiple rollups directly into our Layer 2, creating a meta-state—a clear, unified view of all Ethereum rollups that you can verify yourself. 

### 2. Publicly Verifiable Rollup Over Closed Infrastructure

Polymer’s state database as a rollup on Ethereum, tapping into EigenDA to keep data accessible. This means anyone can run a verifier node to double-check the system on their own terms. We’re taking what could feel like a locked-up, mysterious setup and turning it into something open and dependable.

### Polymer in Ethereum’s Rollup-Centric Vision

In Ethereum’s rollup-centric roadmap, every rollup acts as a scaled extension of the Ethereum network, interconnected through a shared foundation. Polymer is a natural part of this fabric. It enables every connected rollup to maintain an always-updated awareness of the state of all other rollups in the network—crucially, this state remains publicly verifiable.
